# The repository encmpass the full workflow of our modeling, diveded in separates codes

## 1. Training
- Folder "params" >> inside params.json modify all the pamarameters for the TNN and input files.
- Folder "params" >> inside paramsTerrain.json modify all the pamarameters for the DNN, so if only static features.
- ATTENTION: set inference false for the training phase, and true after for the predictions. 
- Run TransformerModels.ipynb for train the model
## 2. Testing
